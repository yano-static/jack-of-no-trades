    <h2 class="subtitle">Childhood Years</h2>
    <p class="bio">
      Growing up as a kid, I never had anyone to play with. not even my family, as the youngest in a family of 7. I was the loneliest kid out of my siblings, while they go out with friends, party, drink, or play sports, I was the kid who stayed at home, either crying alone or just playing alone. Living in the AFP Headquarters from birth to 10 years old, I spent almost my whole childhood in a Soldier's base. Every birthday, and every celebration I spent at that place. I find this place full of fear and emptied of love. I didn't feel like a kid, more like an adult neglected of their emotions. I was a Colonel's son, not a lot of kids wanted to play with me because they were intimidated of me and my father. I only played with one kid named Zaniel, then he suddenly disappeared. Then I was left alone again. Suddenly my father wanted to retire early from the Army, I was excited and scared at once. I was excited I get to finally explore the world outside the Barracks that caged me, Yet scared if I will be accepted by this said world. finally, I'm out. I cried out silently as to not be heard by my family. Growing up, I never showed my emotions to my family, even to this day. Never have I regretted to do so, since they didn't care anyway. I continued my school and living in Dela paz, Pasig City. I schooled at Dee Hwa Liong Academy, where I..kind of met some friends along the way. at 11 to 12 years old, I started taking in hobbies, like sports and music. This helped me a lot in my teenage years.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Teenage Years</h2>
    <p class="bio">
      Teenage years, Still that crybaby who cries alone, but this time, he also sings alone, and plays alone. I learned to play the guitar, and play basketball. Only because my brothers told me so. at first i felt pressured and i was just forced to do it. playing with other people and performing, I wasn't fond of it. but then I did it alone. it was fun, I learned to sing myself, I loved singing and playing for myself. I also played basketball alone, shooting and picking up my own ball, with no one to pressure me to shoot. I loved being alone. I slowly started to get out my comfort zone to perform. It's a blast to perform for yourself. but all that still makes me feel empty, like something's still missing. It's something I never felt before, yet my cells, my heart, they crave for it. I needed someone to talk to. I needed a friend. Fast forward to Senior High School, where I played, performed, I was finally "Someone". But I still feel empty. While I have "Friends", I never was able to trust them for anything. Until I met them. Julia, Marco, Daniela, and someone I don't want to name. They were what filled my void of a heart, I loved them so much. I cried, laughed, shouted at them, yet they still treat me like... how I was supposed to be treated. But I should have known that all this can end. Graduation day, the day we were supposed to say goodbye. I graduated alone. They were nowhere to be found, only traces of hatred, and deadly stares sting through my back. I never got a single conversation with any of them, event until I got up that stage to get my diploma. Never have I received the "Congrats Vincent", "We made it", "Im so proud of us" I expected. as I get out of PICC, I see them, celebrating, without me. It was my fault. I want to come clean and I want to take accountability for my fault. But even after all of that, I still feel depressed, I don't want to trust anyone anymore. I cried, and cried, and cried. The crybaby still cries to this day.

    <h2 class="subtitle">College Years</h2>
    <p class="bio">
      Entering College life, full of scars, disbelief, distrust. I wanted to go back to my childhood, where I just sit alone, crying, playing games. I never wanted to go through my teenage years, my graduating year ever again. As I enter my Freshman year, still in UE, I already had a name for myself. I was the performer, The athlete, and the approachable. I took Computer Science as my major, and so far I'm having fun. in my first year I met some friends along the way, still have them now, but I'm still learning to trust them. We went through lots of hardships together. Academics, Emotional, Deep Talks, and other stuff. I have everything already. I have a good house, a complete, though not fun, family, friends. But most of all, I'm a Jack of All--I'm a Jack of No Trades. I might know everything, but it doesn't amount to knowledge or physicality that can reach to somewhere succesful. Yes I can code, but I can't do any of the complicated things yet like the systems and webapps. Sure, I'm good at basketball and Volleyball, but an amateur athlete could still beat me if they train hard enough. and most of all, I'm a really good singer that knows every instrument, But i could be overdone by a real Vocalist, and a real Instrumentalist, easily. I know everything, yet know nothing. This is the biography of Vincent Palanas, a Jack of No Trades, and the crybaby.
